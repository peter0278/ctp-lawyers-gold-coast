<p>The screech of brakes, the sickening crunch of metal, and the sudden silence that follows a car accident is a physical and emotional shock to the system. Whether it’s a high-speed collision on the M1 or a fender bender in Surfers Paradise traffic, the moments immediately following a crash are often a blur of adrenaline and confusion. Once the dust settles, however, the reality of injuries, medical bills, and time off work sets in.</p>

<p>For most Queensland drivers, Compulsory Third Party (CTP) insurance is just another line item on their registration renewal. Yet, despite paying for it every year, very few people understand how to access it when they are the ones suffering. The system can feel like a maze of paperwork, legislation, and insurance adjusters who seem to speak a different language.</p>

<p>This guide is designed to cut through that confusion. Over the next few pages, we will demystify the claims process, explaining exactly what you need to do to protect your future. From the immediate steps you must take at the scene to understanding the "heads of damage" available to you, this is your roadmap to recovery.</p>

<p>You will learn why partnering with

<h2>Protecting Your Right to Claim</h2>

<h3>Safety and Evidence Gathering</h3>
<p>If anyone is seriously injured, your first call must be to 000. Once safety is established, start documenting everything. Mobile phones are your best tool here.</p>

<h3>Police Reporting</h3>

<h3>Medical Attention is Non-Negotiable</h3>
<p>Immediate medical treatment creates a crucial legal timeline linking injuries to the accident.</p>
